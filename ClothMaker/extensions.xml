  <description>This plugin adds cloth simulation to Art of Illusion. This plugin provides
  the capability for an object in the scene to be converted into a cloth object and for 
  a cloth simulation to be calculated for that object. This simulation will be used during 
  animation to calculate the distortion of the cloth object. This plugin also provides the
  capability to convert the distorted cloth to a rigid object that can be manipulated as
  a non-cloth object. This plugin also adds a Fan scene object which extends the 
  WindSource class. A WindSource produces a force on a cloth object that is both time
  and position dependent.</description>

    <comments>This plugin takes the work from the HangingCloth cloth simulator and turns
    it into a refined tool that can be used within Art of Illusion. </comments>
